student success
- high grades
- course completion
- satisfaction ratings
- post-course outcomes

noisy metrics
- click count
- time spent

things we can do:
- comparison across courses
- attempt prediction of student success markers 
- suggest course adjustments to improve outcomes
- can we guess whether some courses are poorly designed (bad UX, confusing questions, misleading material, etc.) as opposed to, let's say, whether a course is engaging, interesting or fun

todo:
- look at student assessment data


questions:
- can be predict which topics the courses are on?
- course relevancy, course design accessibility, course ease, course engagement, expectations of students
- student performance, student interests, student demographics, expectations of the course


scenario:
- we are consultants who are being brought on by the university to enhance their course offering. we are given the UK open courseware dataset.



why might gamification / external rewards be important to drive engagement?
- need to be seen
- desire for validation
- desire to be seen/valued
