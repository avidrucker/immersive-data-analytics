# "Hereâ€™s an example given by Google developers of something you might do with their API. First, the request your application generates:
```
GET https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?q="in:sent after:2014/01/01 before:2014/01/30"
```
# This request would ping Gmail for messages sent between 1/1/2014 and 1/30/2014. You'd of course need to be authenticated to have access to these messages -- having access to an API doesn't mean you have unfettered access to all data in an external application -- but once you were logged in via the API you could do many things you might do on actual gmail.com.
